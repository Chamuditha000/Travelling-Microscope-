• Many specimens have vertical features or structures that are of particular interest for examination. Vertical movement allows users to navigate through different layers or depths within the specimen, facilitating thorough examination and analysis. Because of that we decided to make a travelling microscope with vertical movement.

• Initially we decided to use thread bar to assemble the microscope body to vertical pillar, but in that case, we were unable to make large vertical movement of microscope body. As a solution, we decided to use metal rod and a spring to assemble microscope body, instead of thread bar. Springs provide a controlled and consistent force, allowing for both large vertical movement and fine vertical movement of the microscope body.

• The vertical adjustment process was simplified by springs, making it easier for users to manipulate the microscope body or lens assembly. This ease of use was enhanced by springs, particularly in high-throughput or time-sensitive microscopy tasks, improving efficiency and productivity.

• The focusing mechanism of a traveling microscope typically involves a system of knobs and screws that allow users to adjust the position of the microscope's lens to the specimen being observed.

• This mechanism enables users to achieve precise focusing for clear and detailed observation. By tightening and loosening the large vertical movement screw, the large movement of the microscope body can be done. Then using the fine movement knob, precise vertical movement of the microscope body can be performed.

• The vernier scale was designed by dividing 19mm of main scale into 20 parts (smallest measurement can be taken = 0.05mm). Numerical values representing the measurement units were added to both the main scale and the vernier scale, using text tools in AutoCAD.

• While using the welding machine the materials to be welded should be cleaned and prepared before starting the welding process. Remove any dirt, rust, or contaminants from the surfaces using wire brushes or grinding tools. Otherwise, it would be caused by poor weld quality. And attention should be paid to properly aligning and clamping the workpieces to ensure they are held securely in position during the welding process.

• While cutting or drilling the metal bars, boxes, or plates, they should be securely held in place stably using clamps or a vise. It was ensured that the workpiece was stable and wouldn't shift during cutting, minimizing the risk of inaccuracies or accidents.

## Achievements:
The successful creation of a traveling microscope equipped with both coarse and fine adjustments in the vertical
direction was achieved as the final outcome of the project.
Accuracy and Uncertainty:
The least count of the travelling microscope = 0.05 mm
Instrument error = ± 0.05 mm
User uncertainty = ± 0.02mm
Accuracy and uncertainty = user uncertainty + least count = ± 0.07mm
## Advantages:
• Compact and Lightweight Design: The device's compact and lightweight design facilitates easy
transportation, ensuring portability and convenience.
• User-Friendly Operation: With an easily learnable measuring mechanism, even beginners with no prior
knowledge can use the device effortlessly, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
• Cost-Effective and Durable: The traveling microscope is an affordable option with low material costs and
a robust build, ensuring durability in harsh environments.
• Minimal Maintenance Requirements: Constructed primarily from metals like steel and galvanized iron,
the device requires minimal maintenance, cleaning, and storage facilities, offering long-lasting reliability
with little effort.
• Onsite Operation for Real-Time Decisions: The device allows for onsite operation, enabling immediate
measurements and real-time decision-making, streamlining processes, and enhancing efficiency.
• Non-Invasive Measurement: The measuring process ensures that the object under examination remains
untouched, preventing any compression or damage, preserving the integrity of the subject.
• Zero Operating Electric Power: Operating without the need for electricity, the device offers cost savings
and environmental friendliness, making it an efficient and sustainable option.

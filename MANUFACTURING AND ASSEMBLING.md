## **Base**
The base provides stability and support for the entire microscope. It is usually a heavy and flat structure to ensure  
the instrument remains steady during measurements.

- Initially, a detailed design for the base was created, taking into consideration the dimensions of the  
  microscope components and the stability needed.
- Then the metal plate was cut according to the design by using a grinder.
- The edges and corners of the metal plate were smoothed using a metal file.
- The locations for holes needed to mount the vertical pillar and other components of the microscope  
  were identified.
- These holes were drilled using an appropriate-sized drill bit.
- The microscope components were assembled onto the base, securing them in place with screws and bolts.

## **Vertical Pillar or Column**
The vertical pillar or column rises from the base and provides vertical support for the rest of the microscope  
components. It is an essential part of the structural framework.

- Primarily, a detailed design for the vertical pillar was created, considering the required height, stability,  
  and any specific features.
- The box bars were cut according to the design using a bar cutter machine or hacksaw.
- The locations for holes needed were marked and those holes were drilled using an appropriate-sized drill bit.
- Then the thin slot was made by using the milling machine.
- The edges and corners of the box bars and thin slot were smoothed using a metal file.
- Then the interior mechanism of the pillar was designed, considering the functionality required for  
  adjusting the height of the microscope body.
- A spring was used to assist in raising or lowering the microscope body.
- The appropriate location for the spring within the mechanism was identified and a hollow cylinder was  
  used to maintain a proper movement of the spring.
- Then the hollow cylinder was welded to the bottom of the vertical pillar and the spring was placed inside  
  the cylinder.
- An iron rod was used to keep the smooth vertical movement of the microscope body.
- Then the microscope body was attached to the iron rod using an iron bush and a bolt. Large movement  
  of the microscope body can be done by tightening and loosening this screw.

## **Microscope Body or Barrel**
The microscope body houses the optics, including the objective lens and eyepiece. It is attached to the vertical  
pillar and can be moved up or down for focusing.

- Primitively, a design for the body or barrel was created, considering the required dimensions and specifications.
- Attention was given to accommodating the optical components and providing structural stability.
- Metal pipes were cut to the desired lengths based on the design specifications, using metal cutting tools  
  such as a hacksaw, angle grinder, or metal cutting bandsaw.
- The cut metal pipes were shaped as per the design requirements using metalworking tools.
- This involved removing sharp edges by using a metal file; a smooth and even surface was created using a  
  lathe machine.
- Then a groove was created to prevent rotation around the axis of the inner barrel. A milling machine was  
  used for this task.
- As the necessary mechanism to adjust the focus length, a hole was made on the outer barrel and a screw  
  was inserted through it.
- The various components, including lenses and eyepieces, were assembled onto the metal pipes.
- Then the outer barrel was welded perpendicularly to another iron rod using a welding machine, and that  
  whole system was attached to the vertical pillar.
- The assembled metal pipes were checked for any sharp edges or imperfections.
- Any irregularities were addressed, and the surface was finished to ensure a polished and professional appearance.

## **Screw and Nut Mechanism**
The microscope's movement is controlled by a screw and nut mechanism. This allows precise and controlled  
motion along the vertical pillar, enabling accurate focusing on the specimen.

- A design for the screw and nut mechanism was created, considering the required precision and control  
  for the movement of the microscope along the vertical pillar. Then a metal box was made to be slightly  
  larger than the vertical pillar. A suitable screw was chosen based on strength and durability.
- To attach the end of the screw, a metal knob was built.
- The appropriate knurling tool for the desired knurl pattern was chosen.
- The lathe speed was adjusted to a moderate speed suitable for knurling, and the knurling tool was  
  positioned on the metal rod, ensuring it was aligned perpendicular to the axis of the rod.
- The lathe was started, and cutting oil or lubricant was applied to the metal rod and knurling tool to reduce  
  friction and heat generation during the knurling process.
- The knurling process was repeated with adjustments to the tool pressure or feed rate until the desired  
  knurl pattern was achieved.
- Once the knurling was complete, any burrs or rough edges from the ends of the knurled section were  
  removed using a file.
- Then threads were cut into the metal box using thread-cutting tools, and the knob was welded to the end  
  of the screw.
- The assembled screw and nut mechanism underwent thorough testing to ensure smooth and controlled  
  motion along the vertical pillar of the microscope.
- Once installed onto the vertical pillar of the traveling microscope, the large movement of the microscope  
  body could be controlled by tightening and loosening the screw.

## **Fine Adjustment Knob**
The fine adjustment knob allows for precise focusing of the image. It is used to make small adjustments to the  
position of the microscope body for accurate measurements.

- Using a similar procedure, a fine adjustment screw was made and installed onto the vertical pillar at the top.
- Using this knob, small adjustments to the position of the microscope body can be operated.

## **Main Scale and Vernier Scale**
Traveling microscopes often include scales and verniers for measuring the linear dimensions of the specimen.  
These scales are typically graduated and can be read with high precision.

- Both main and vernier scales were designed using AutoCAD.
- The drawing settings, including units, grid, and dimensions, were configured according to the requirements  
  of the vernier scale design.
- The appropriate drawing tools, such as lines, circles, and text, were selected from the AutoCAD toolbar.
- The main scale was designed by drawing a straight line with the appropriate length and marking the  
  divisions corresponding to the measurement units.
- The vernier scale was drawn parallel to the main scale, by dividing 19mm into 20 parts (smallest  
  measurement can be taken = 0.05mm).
- Numerical values representing the measurement units were added to both the main scale and the vernier  
  scale using text tools in AutoCAD.
- The completed vernier scale design was saved in the desired file format and printed as a sticker. Then  
  the scale was stuck onto the vertical pillar.

## **Lens Holders**
- The lens holders were also designed using AutoCAD software.
- The appropriate design tools in AutoCAD, such as lines, circles, and 3D modeling features, were selected  
  for creating the lens holders.
- The measurements and specifications of the microscope's lenses were analyzed to ensure the accurate  
  design of the lens holders.
- Multiple designs for the lens holders were sketched in AutoCAD, considering factors such as shape and size.
- Once the designs were finalized, they were exported from AutoCAD in a compatible file format, such as  
  STL or OBJ, for 3D printing.
- The prepared design files were transferred to the 3D printer, and the printing process was initiated.
- The 3D printer manufactured the lens holders layer by layer using the chosen printing material.
- After printing was completed, the lens holders were inspected for any defects and installed onto the  
  microscope assembly.

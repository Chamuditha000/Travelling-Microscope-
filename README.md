# Travelling-Microscope 
This project creates a 1 ftÂ³ traveling microscope with a sliding mechanism, vernier scale, and rotatable microscope. Using workshop tools like lathes and milling machines, it enhances precision engineering skills. The cost-efficient, adjustable, and durable design supports scientific research, education, and local manufacturing innovation.
